*What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?*

- it assumes that people are computer literate and that they know what they are doing
- suited for hacking 
- gives user complete control 

*In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?*

VPS has similarities to both a shared server and dedicated server. It is like a dedicated server in the sense that the user has a lot of contol over their environment - but it is not one physical server. It is one server partitioned into separate containers. 

A virtual private server 
The advantages are:

- there is no risk of someone else messing with your website's performance like in shared hosting
- it is not as expensive as a dedicated server but has similar functionality 
- you can easily upgrade if you have more traffic to your site than what you intially imagined- this can be done without any down time  

*Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?*

Programs should be run on a user level. Admin tasks should be run as the root user. If you are logged in as root, this means that all applications are running at that level which exposes your system to viruses.
