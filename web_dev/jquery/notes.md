*Mal's Epic Plan to Tackle (metaphorically) JQuery*

- First find additional high level explanation of JQuery to get the BIG picture idea 
- I find Codeacademy helpful, so I would at least like to spend some time on those tutorials even though I won't complete the entire course 
- Check out what W3School has to say 
- Google for some sort of official JQuery docs
- Google JQuery for beginners 
- Google JQuery cheat sheets

I need to stop and test my knowledge after I learn a chunk of new information. If I am just reading about something without practically applying it, I usually do not end up fully grasping the concept. 

Short breaks are important to me. Even just 10-15 minutes to look away from my computer. When I jump back in, I am always a bit amazed at the difference that it makes.

*BRO. WHAT WORKED?*

It worked well to start with a youtube introduction to jQuery and then move to Codeacademy for some practical application/syntax. After, I took a look at various articles and checked out some cheat sheets. I started working on my project AS I was researching so I could build on it as I learned.
