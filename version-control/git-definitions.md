# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the ability to track changes made to a file. You can see who made changes and choose whether or not to merge those changes into the master branch. You also have the ability to revert back to any version of the file throughout its timeline. Developers use it because it is the best way to preserve the source code and also track bugs. It allows multiple people to work on one project.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of a project you are working on. It preserves the source code in the master branch while allowing you to perfect the new project before merging it with the master branch. You would use a branch to implement a new feature or work on a certain aspect of a project.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is basically a save point when you are working in a repository. Commit messages should be specific to the changes that have been made since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict happens when two collaborators change the same line or lines of a file. Github does not know which change to make.
